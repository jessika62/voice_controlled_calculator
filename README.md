# voice_controlled_calculator
This project is a Voice-Controlled Calculator built in Python with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter. It allows users to speak arithmetic expressions such as "five plus seven" or "nine divided by three", converts speech to text using speech_recognition, evaluates the expression, and then displays and speaks the result using pyttsx3.
